0.9.6.1
    * Fixed bug in Sarissa.updateContentFromNode thanks to Franky Braem
    * Added Safari DOMParser support thanks to a wonderfull idea published 
      by Nate Steiner on his blog that utilizes the data: URI scheme and 
      Erik Arvidsson that suggested this could easily be wrapped to emulate 
      DOMParser. Many thanks to cedric for pointing out the above (between other things).
    * Removed XSLTProcessor.tranfrormToFragment (didn't work anyway)
    * Added .load support for Opera thanks to cedric
    * Added support for HTML nodes in Sarissa.serialize
    * Tried to make Safari sniffing more strict thanks to Phil Green who pointed out spoofing is easy
    * Fixed bugs thanks to feedback by Vincenzo Alcamo


0.9.6
    * Deprecated stuff as warned in 0.9.4 ;-)
    * Big change: loadXML is no longer used, as there's no way to emulate it in Opera.
      So i just removed it directly; to load an XML string to a DOM, you have to use the 
      DOMParser object. No way to do anything like that in Safari though.
    * Added Minesweeper as first sample application, original code kindly donated by
      Sean Whalen, also maintainer of it; welcome Sean!
    * Fixed Opera and Safari issues  thanks to Phil Endecott and Conrad Chu
    * Fixed Sarissa.getText bug (ignored CDATA) thanks to Noah Bast
    * Added Sarissa.moveChildNodes and a third optional parameter to Sarissa.copyChildNodes (preserved old behavior by default)

    * Upgraded JSDoc and ECMAUnit

0.9.5.1 
    * Added Sarissa.escape and Sarissa.unescape, to convert

    * NOTE: Deprecated stuff will go away in 0.9.6. You have been warned!
    * Refactored to suport KHTML/Webcore (Konqueror/Safari) 
    * Added some constants to check for availability of features. 
    * the xml property is now deprecated. Use Sarissa.serialize instead

      directly. Many thanks to Rob (Flaherty?) for the bug report and initial patch.
